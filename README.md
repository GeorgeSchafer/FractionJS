# FractionJS

Welcome to and thank you for your interest in FractionJS.

## Why Fractions?

Although decimals are the standard for computer science, Fractions can contain information that is lost due to rounding.

3/4 is easily expressed as a decimal : 0.25

3/7 is not easily expressed as a decimal : 0.428571...

Generally the information lost is negligible. However, for some mathematical operations (ex. using Radians) it is much preferable to preserve this information.

## Download

Download the [libs](https://github.com/GeorgeSchafer/FractionJS/blob/demo/libs/) folder and use as needed. These files are meant to be external libraries to be added to another project, so they are located in the libs folder.
