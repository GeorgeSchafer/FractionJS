# ENUMJS ReadMe

I use my personal implementation of ENUMs which. Here is the link:
https://github.com/GeorgeSchafer/ENUMJS

Clone the libarary with:
$ git clone https://github.com/GeorgeSchafer/ENUMJS.git

The repository contains both a cjs and mjs implementation.

Use the Demo branch as it is the most thoroughly tested.
