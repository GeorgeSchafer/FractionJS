# ENUMJS ReadMe

I use my personal implementation of [ENUMs](https://github.com/GeorgeSchafer/ENUMJS).

Clone the library with: 

```
$ git clone https://github.com/GeorgeSchafer/ENUMJS.git
```

The repository contains both a cjs and mjs implementation.

Use the Release branch as it is the most thoroughly tested.
